          The manual development of photographs is a traditional practice that has been upheld due to its versatile possibilities. Fanatics have preserved this craft despite the advances in printing technology to maintain the integrity and the true authenticity of the craft. Although, this craft is desired to be maintained there is no reason why the way of developing prints couldn’t be automated whilst upholding the purity of the process and maintaining artistic freedoms. 'Blackbox' is a new way for photographic artists to develop their wall prints in a dark room. It aims to overcome the inconveniences of dark room work whilst providing a consistent finish to prints. As well as this because 'Blackbox' is programmable for the user - it allows artists to retain their freedoms from hand printings, such as exposure time, temperature etc... </p>

           <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">How does it work?</h2>
          <p class="text-primary">'Blackbox' aims to deliver flawless wall prints, but how does it work? Photography enuthisasts will know that developing wall prints from film occurs in 3 main steps, these are illustrated in the picture below.</p>
          <figure>
              <img src='Images\Process.png' alt='Photo printing process'/>
           </figure>
           <p class="text-primary">So where does 'Blackbox' come in? Blackbox, once complete, will deliver on these main specification points:</p>
           <ol>
              <li>Be able to produce flawless wall prints in both colour and black & white</li>
              <li>Automatically transistion from one chemical bath to the next, the timings of this all user contronlable</li>
              <li>Pre-heat chemical baths to desired set point</li>
              <li>Automatically wash prints at the end of the process, and allow them space to dry safely</li>
              <li>Provide suitable chemical agitation in each of the chemical baths that require it</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Reasons for Development</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Working in Darkness - We noticed that low light levels (red if you are developing black and white or complete darkness if you are developing colour) are required to get the optimal photograph. This makes the process time consuming as the technician has to feel their way around the dark room to find the right containers whilst being careful not to back contaminate the developing liquids. We found it requires the user to have a lot of practice and experience with the process and their surroundings, which could be off-putting to novices.</li>
              <li>Timekeeping - Although not crucial, timing for each chemical stage has a direct influence on the quality and longevity of a print. The requirement to work in a light-free environment makes it difficult to effectively time keep during development</li>
              <li>Inconsistent Finish - It can be hard to produce consistent prints in a darkroom, we belive by automating the process we can achieve the required finish time after time.</li>

Here we have at our disposal the latest rapid prototyping equipment to produce our product. Early on we were able to identify team members strengths & weaknesses to better deploy each others skills in this task. It was during this time that we landed on the idea of a print development machine. Before we could continue we had to assess the feasibility of such a product.</p>

This process of funnelling down our direction with the project has been based on two processes; firstly brain storming ideas (getting them down on paper) and secondly agile interation with stakeholders. This meant asking questions to those that are more expierenced, either in the process of prototyping or in photography. We have been closely working with members of Imperial College Darkroom, this has allowed us to better understand what challenges our target customers face and what issues we can overcome with this product.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">There are a few key tools that have been used to aid the development of this website. It is easy to get lost or overcomplicate the web development process, but these applications have proved invaluable to complete this site. The first of application of use was Atom. Atom is a desktop text editor that is the core of any web developer’s toolbox. It is developed by Github and works in tandem with it to host web code in HTML, Javascript and CSS. Its here that files are stored & found, and the code built to run the site. Github is another desktop application that host code repositories. This is the software that allows you to create and push your edited code in HTML to the web. The most useful thing about Github is the version control system, which allows developers to create a history of changes that occur over time in their code. I found this especially useful to revert to an old version when a change caused a “bit of a mess”. Github does also allow for easy collaboration with other developers, but that functionality wasn’t explored. Due to inexperience the website started as a template from Bootstrap – from here it was easy to see and download a template that was desirable. This could then be loaded into Atom and freely edited to create a more unique webpage. One thing I found particularly helpful is Google’s built in ‘inspect’ tool, this allowed to find a specific line of HTML relevant to an element very quickly.

To create a custom domain first you must register the name you’d like with a domain name system, to make sure it is not already taken. Ordinarily you’d have to pay this company to host your unique domain and connect it to an IP address. Once you have got your custom domain you can add it to you page in Github – another benefit of using this tool.  </p>

          <h4 class="service-heading">Website Design</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">(i) A good website for me comes down to two main things; how functional it is and how immersive it is. In terms of functionality you want a website that is easy to navigate with an intuitive user interface. You want a site that loads fast and isn’t too clunky with large data features. As for how immersive a site is, I really enjoy sites that have large hi-res photos or features that move or explode as you scroll through them. It’s about tailoring a good aesthetic for the targeted user. </p>
          <p class="text-muted">(ii) Web accessibility is ensuring that a website is free from barriers that could prevent those with disability or restrictions from accessing a site. This could include those with impaired vision or hearing, those that suffer from photosensitive seizures, people with cognitive conditions such as dyslexia. Considerations in design can be made for these people so they’re still able to access and enjoy surfing the web. Colour and structure is a big thing to consider here. You should aim to not put traditional colour-blind pairings together (like red & green). You should understand not to fill the page with dense text. Be aware not to have repeatedly flashing images. Apart from design there are tools that can be deployed to help these people as well. Such as, resizable text or voice dictation options for text filling. You can also add alternative descriptions to photos, something I’ve don’t, so that in page dictation the pictures are interpreted too. </p>
          <p class="text-muted">(iii) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal data protection and privacy framework upheld by the European Union which defines how personal information of EU residents is processed. It encompasses 7 key data handling principles. These cover how data is collected ensuring there is a legitimate reason for holding data. Data transparency in relation to individuals. Limiting data storage and deleting data after it has been used. And who is accountable in storing data and demonstrating compliance. In terms of this sites GDPR compliance, it currently doesn’t have the functionality to collect data. But if it did it would be GDPR compliant. It would give option for users to opt-out of any data set and uphold their right to be forgotten from that set.  </p>
          <p class="text-muted">(iv) To drive traffic to this website, I would first deploy search engine optimisation and potentially pay for an add on search engines to appear at the top of certain searches, like “home dark room” for example. I can incorporate targeted adds on social media and do postings on community network pages. I can also include a QR code on the product to get users to interact with the site and get after sale support, this at a full extent could even include a forum or community sharing feature to allow users to connect. Thus increasing traffic.  </p>
          <p class="text-muted">(v) If additional time given, I could add functions to allow users to make account on the website to purchase product directly. Or create the product comunity page mentioned. Embedded videos or short docu-videos would also be nice to explain more visually about the product.</p>
